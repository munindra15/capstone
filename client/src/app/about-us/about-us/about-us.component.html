            This website was developed as a capstone project for my final
            semester at Conestoga college while i was attending Web Design and
            Development course in the 2020-21. It was an amazing experience
            building this application from scratch.

          <h2 class="display-6">How did i make it?</h2>
          <p class="lead text-muted">
            -> I utilized Angular as the front-end framework and Express in the
            backed using Node.js and MongoDB as the database. Additionally, i
            used JWT to incorporate user authentications and authorization using
            session storage.<br />
            -> I started of creating the API in express and modeling the
            database in MongoDB. In order to get cross collection support i used
            refrences in mongoDb. Thereafter, creating controllers, routes and
            tokenVerification authorization controllers.<br />
            -> To provide a secure password storage i utilized salt, and hash
            which is encrypted using the standard sha512 encryption. <br />
            -> Salt is a random 16 characted hex string which is generated from
            the real password.<br />
            -> Hash is a 64 characters string which is generated by converting
            and encrypting the SALT key.
